Enigma
======

Enigma simulator that accompanied my high school final paper (2011)

The simulator was created in less than a day. It could mean an extra 10 points to the grade, if handed in with the paper.
Sadly the teacher did not remotely know how the enigma worked. This was glaringly obvious when he talked about the fact my program didn't allow any numbers to be encoded. "Negative points for that" he said.  
To no avail I replied "But, sir, The enigma rotors were only equiped to do up to 26 characters. If you wanted to use numbers you would either have to spell them out or have all the parties involved use digit rotors."   
Switching alpahabet rotors to digit rotors, although it was possible, of course rarely happened. There were not many digit rotors made.  
In the end it was only 5 points extra. However, the development and deep understanding of the enigma was well worth it.

It even implements the famous double stepping 'functionality'(which was a mechanical flaw) :D
